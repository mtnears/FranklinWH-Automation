# Changelog

All notable changes to FranklinWH Battery Automation.

---

## v3.2.0 — February 2026

### API-Native Mode Management
- Mode detection reads directly from the gateway's `run_status` field via `_status()` API
- Mode switching uses direct `set_mode()` API calls through the franklinwh library
- Eliminates dependency on state files (`last_mode.txt`, `peak_state.txt`)
- Eliminates external switch scripts (`switch_to_backup_v2.py`, `switch_to_tou_v2.py`)
- Universal mode detection via `run_status` codes: 1=Emergency Backup, 2=TOU, 3=Self Consumption
- Post-switch verification confirms mode actually changed
- Single API client instance for stats, status, and mode switching

### Schedule-Aware Timing
- Pre-peak check pinned to exact time (PEAK_START - buffer minutes)
- Post-peak check pinned to exact time (PEAK_END + 1 minute)
- Guarantees peak transitions are never missed regardless of polling interval
- Supports secondary peak period with same transition logic

### Per-Battery Monitoring
- Individual SOC tracking per battery (`fhpSoc` array)
- Individual power output per battery (`fhpPower` array)
- Automatic detection of battery count
- Per-battery data in intelligence log and CSV

### Enriched Data Logging
- Ambient temperature (°F/°C) from gateway sensor
- Cellular signal strength
- Grid-to-battery and solar-to-battery charging rates
- Dynamic CSV columns for per-battery SOC

### New Configuration
- `CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES` — configurable polling frequency (1-60 min)
- `PEAK_TRANSITION_BUFFER_MINUTES` — how early to check before peak
- `HOME_MODE` — normal operating mode (`tou` or `self_consumption`)

### Upgrade Notes
Add these lines to your `.env` file before rebuilding:
```bash
CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15
PEAK_TRANSITION_BUFFER_MINUTES=5
HOME_MODE=tou
```
Then: `git pull && docker compose down && docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d`

## v3.1.1 — January 2026

### Docker Improvements
- Fixed Docker path handling for all scripts
- Daily savings automation added to scheduler
- Historical data migration into Docker system

### Dashboard
- Enhanced three-tab dashboard (Live, Weekly Reports, System Logs)
- Fixed charging status logic (±0.1kW standby threshold)
- PVOutput sync integration

---

## v3.1.0 — January 2026

### Complete Docker Overhaul
- Self-contained Docker package with internal scheduler
- Built-in web dashboard with nginx (port 8100)
- Proper permission handling
- No external cron or Task Scheduler needed
- All tasks managed by internal Python scheduler

### Dashboard Features
- Real-time battery status and energy flow visualization
- Weekly performance charts (SOC timeline, daily summary, power flow)
- System logs viewer with auto-refresh
- Savings tracker

---

## v3.0.0 — January 2026

### Configuration-Driven Architecture
- All settings via `.env` file — no more editing Python scripts
- Feature toggles: Solar, TOU, Dynamic Pricing, Weather, PVOutput
- Configurable peak hours, peak days, charge strategies
- `config.py` module for centralized configuration management

### New Features
- Dynamic pricing support (ComEd hourly pricing API)
- Multiple peak period support (split peaks)
- Configurable charging strategy (conservative/balanced/aggressive)
- Weather data collection integration
- PVOutput solar tracking integration

### Backward Compatibility
- Default settings match v2.x behavior
- Existing log files and data preserved

---

## v2.0 — December 2025

### Smart 15-Minute Decision Engine
- Single `smart_decision.py` replaces three separate scripts
- Runs every 15 minutes instead of 3 fixed times per day
- Peak state tracking prevents mode changes during peak hours
- 5-attempt API retry logic for reliability
- Fixed critical midnight rollover bug from v1

### Improvements over v1
- More responsive to changing solar conditions
- Handles edge cases (midnight rollover, daylight saving time)
- Comprehensive logging with intelligence log
- CSV data logging for historical analysis

---

## v1.0 — November 2025

### Initial Release
- Three-tier automation: morning, midday, final safety check
- Fixed schedule: 8 AM, 2 PM, 3:30 PM
- Basic solar vs grid charging logic
- Franklin WH API integration via franklinwh library
